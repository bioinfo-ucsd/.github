## Welcome to the Github Org for UCSD Bioinformatics!

This organization serves as a hub for documentation, code, and other materials to support bioinformatics at UCSD and the wider community. This is a place for students and faculty of the program to collaborate and develop a shared set of resources pertaining to the program. Contributions by the public are also welcome via pull request.
