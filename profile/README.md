## Welcome to Bioinformatics at UC San Diego!

Created by students of the [UCSD Bioinformatics and Systems Biology / Biomedical Informatics (BISB/BMI) PhD program](https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/), this organization serves as a place where students and faculty of the BISB/BMI program can collaborate and develop ...

1. program resources to support students' advancement towards their degrees
2. materials for events, teaching, and outreach initiatives
3. guidelines and tutorials for comptutional biology and bioinformatics workflows (we welcome contributions from *anybody* via pull request!)

With these materials, we hope the organization will support bioinformatics and computational biology at UC San Diego and the wider community.

Here's how to get started:

1. üë©‚Äçüíª Take a look at our [contribution guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. üåà Please abide by our [community code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
