## Welcome to Bioinformatics at UC San Diego!

Created by students of the [UCSD Bioinformatics and Systems Biology / Biomedical Informatics (BISB/BMI) PhD program](https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/), this organization serves as a place where students and faculty of the BISB/BMI program can collaborate and develop ...

1. resources pertaining to the PhD program
2. guidelines and executable tutorials for comptutional biology and bioinformatics workflows (we welcome contributions from *anybody* via pull request!)

With these materials, we hope the organization will support computational biology and bioinformatics at UC San Diego and the wider community.

Here's how to get started:

1. üë©‚Äçüíª Take a look at our [contribution guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. üåà Please abide by our [community code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
